# Description

A frontend website. This project is built using HTML, CSS (SASS and Bootstrap), and JavaScript (React with Vite).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the web pages.
- **CSS (SASS)**: Styling and theming. I used SASS for improved CSS organization and maintainability.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design.
- **JavaScript (React)**: To build the dynamic and interactive parts of the website.
- **Vite**: The build tool used for development and production builds.
- **Vercel**: The hosting platform where the website is deployed.
